During the workshop 8 I figured out what is the pure virtual functions and how to define them. Basically, the pure virtual functions do not require any implementations, they just need access to the signatures.

Another concept learned in this workshop is the creation of abstract base classes. Abstract base class has no implementations for its pure virtual functions, and usually it is just a pure interface with no member variables.

The next concept is implementing of virtual functions. Virtual function is a member function that is declared in a base class and then is redefined in a derived class. The virtual function is declared in the base class.

In addition, I learned what is the distinction between an abstract base class and a concrete class. An abstract base class is an interface, the declaration of the functions, while a concrete class implements the interface, defines the functions of the base class.
